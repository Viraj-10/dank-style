# State Bases Styles

```jsx
export type STATES =
  | 'indeterminate'
  | 'checked'
  | 'readOnly'
  | 'required'
  | 'invalid'
  | 'focus'
  | 'focusVisible'
  | 'hover'
  | 'pressed'
  | 'active'
  | 'loading'
  | 'disabled';
```

- This includes the ability to define styles based on the component's state. This allows you to create dynamic and interactive styles that change based on user interactions or other events.
- The extended component accept a **`states`** prop, which is an object containing the state of the component. This prop can contain any number of state keys and values, such as **`{hover: true, active: true}`**. The library then uses this prop to apply the corresponding state styles to the component.
- The **`states`** prop allows developers to easily control the state of the component and its styles. For example, it can be used to apply hover styles to a button when the mouse is over the button, or to apply active styles to a button when it is clicked. The library uses the **`states`** prop to look up the state styles in the global style map and apply them to the component.
- It's important to note that the **`states`** prop is optional and will be used only if passed, otherwise the component will use the default styles.
- Here's an example of how the **`states`** prop can be used:

```jsx
const StyledButton = styled(
  Pressable,
  {
    'padding': 8,
    'borderRadius': 4,
    'backgroundColor': '$green400',
    ':hover': {
      backgroundColor: '$blue800',
    },
    ':active': {
      backgroundColor: '$pink400',
    },
  },
  {},
  {}
);

function Button() {
  const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false);
  const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);

  return (
    <StyledButton
      states={{ hover: isHovered, active: isActive }}
      onMouseEnter={() => setIsHovered(true)}
      onMouseLeave={() => setIsHovered(false)}
      onMouseDown={() => setIsActive(true)}
      onMouseUp={() => setIsActive(false)}
    >
      Click Me
    </StyledButton>
  );
}
```

In the example above, we have a functional component Button that wraps a **`StyledButton`** component, which is the component returned by the **`styled`** function. The **`Button`** component uses useState hooks to keep track of whether the button is currently being hovered over or pressed (active). It then passes the current state to the **`StyledButton`** component via the **`states`** prop.

When the button is hovered over, the **`isHovered`** state is set to **`true`**, which causes the **`StyledButton`** component to apply the **`hover`** styles to itself. When the button is pressed, the **`isActive`** state is set to **`true`**, which causes the **`StyledButton`** component to apply the **`active`** styles to itself.

This way the developer can easily control the state of the component and its styles with the help of **`states`** prop.

**State specificity Map**

```jsx
const STATE_PRECENDENCE: any = {
  indeterminate: 1,
  checked: 1,
  readOnly: 1,

  required: 2,
  invalid: 2,

  focus: 3,
  focusVisible: 4,
  hover: 5,
  pressed: 6,
  active: 6,
  loading: 7,

  disabled: 10,
};
```

- State specificity
  - State props get resolved based on the above state precedence
  - if we pass `hover` style and `invalid` style to a component, `hover` will get applied to the component
- Nested specificity
  - Nested declared state props are more specific
