# Platform Based Styles

- This allows you to easily create styles that are specific to a particular platform that is, Web, iOS, or Android.

```jsx
const Box = styled(
  View,
  {
    borderRadius: '$full',
    _web: {
      bg: '$amber500',
    },
    _ios: {
      bg: '$blue500',
    },
    _android: {
      bg: '$red500',
    },
  },
  {}
);
```

Although we provide this feature we do not recommend using it extensively

It is worth noting that, while this approach allows for a more customized experience on each platform, it can also make the codebase more complex and harder to maintain, as it requires additional logic to handle the different props for different platforms.
Therefore, it is important to strike a balance between providing a customized experience and keeping the codebase maintainable.
